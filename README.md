# SurveyProject

This was an open-ended project that tested data analysis skills in regards to figuring out what trends/information would be most beneficial for the fictional client to know. Analysis pertained to which groups of employees were most satisfied, least satisfied, in which regions and so on. Only the directions of the assignment (Take Home Quiz.pdf) and data (job-sat.txt) were given. I imported the txt file in RStudio and converted data frame into a Excel csv file within the Rstudio program. I used the Excel csv file to create data visualizations with various pivot tables. I initially conducted predictive model analysis to determine the model that best fit the data (ProjectWork.Rmd). Once I completed this task, I then streamlined the look of the analysis conducted in RStudio and that can be found in the file CDA Take Home Quiz.Rmd. Finally I complied my report, within Microsoft Word, as if it was to be presented to a manager with the business need to know (Satisfaction Survey Report.docx).
